I have a camera that takes really nice raw photos. Unfortunately, raw photos take up a lot of space.  
This tool can read all photos in a specified directory and convert a copy to a compressed format.  

This way all shots can be quickly reviewed and only the best need to be imported, saving time and space.
This is especially useful when taking a lot of similar shots or when using burst mode.  
~300 photos can take up around 7GB of space but after conversion it takes up < 300MB.

My camera is a Sony so raw photos are `.ARW`. 
`.Jpeg` is the fastest to convert to but it could be modified to use other input and output types.
