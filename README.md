I have a camera that takes really nice raw photos.  Unfortunately, raw photos take up a lot of space.  
This tool can read all photos in a specified directory and convert them to a compressed format that can be more easily reviewed.
My camera is a sony so its `.ARW` -> `.jpeg` but it could probably be modified to use other raw photo types.
